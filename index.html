  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 6, 2026</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Tanya rescues the cats</strong> (the “App”) handles user data.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The App itself does not collect or store personal data. However, the App uses third-party advertising services, which may collect limited technical information from your device to serve relevant ads.</p>

  <h2>2. Advertising and Use of Data</h2>
  <p>We use <strong>IronSource</strong> to display advertisements. IronSource and its advertising partners may collect and process the following non-personally identifiable information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising ID (AAID on Android)</li>
    <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
    <li>IP address (used for approximate geolocation, such as country/region)</li>
    <li>Network type and carrier</li>
    <li>App usage data (e.g., ad interaction, session duration)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is used solely for advertising purposes, including ad personalization, frequency capping, and performance measurement.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>Data collected via ads may be shared with IronSource and its demand partners (e.g., ad networks, DSPs). These companies operate under their own privacy policies. We do not control their practices.</p>
  <p>Relevant policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.ironsrc.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IronSource Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.ironsrc.com/childrens-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IronSource Children’s Privacy Notice</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>You can limit ad personalization on your Android device by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Going to <strong>Settings → Google → Ads</strong></li>
    <li>Enabling <strong>“Opt out of Ads Personalization”</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: You will still see ads, but they will not be tailored to your interests.</p>

  <h2>5. No Data Collected by the Developer</h2>
  <p>The developer of this App does not access, store, or process any user data directly. All advertising-related data is handled by IronSource and its partners.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted here with a new “Last updated” date.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
