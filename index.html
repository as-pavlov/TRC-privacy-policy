  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 6, 2026</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Tanya rescues the cats</strong> (the “App”) handles user data.</p>

  <h2>1. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This App is designed for children under 13 years of age and complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Our advertising partner (IronSource) may collect limited non-personal device data for ad delivery, but no personally identifiable information is collected or shared. We encourage parents and guardians to supervise their children’s online activities.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The App itself does not collect or store personal data. However, third-party advertising services integrated into the App may collect limited technical information from your device to serve relevant ads in accordance with COPPA requirements.</p>

  <h2>3. Advertising and Use of Data</h2>
  <p>We use <strong>IronSource</strong> to display advertisements. IronSource and its partners may collect the following non-personal information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising ID (AAID on Android)</li>
    <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
    <li>IP address (used only for approximate geolocation, such as country)</li>
    <li>Network type and carrier</li>
    <li>App usage data (e.g., ad impressions, session length)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is used solely for non-personalized advertising purposes, as required for apps directed at children under COPPA.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>Data may be shared with IronSource and its advertising partners. We do not control their practices. IronSource adheres to COPPA and offers child-safe ad inventory.</p>

  <h2>5. No Personal Data Collected by Developer</h2>
  <p>The developer does not access, store, or process any user data directly. All advertising-related data handling is performed by IronSource in compliance with COPPA.</p>
